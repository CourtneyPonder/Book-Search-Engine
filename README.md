# Book-Search-Engine
This application takes a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.



## User Story

```
AS AN avid reader
I WANT to search for new books to read
SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase
```

## Technologies

Has an Apollo Server that uses GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

Uses an Apollo Server and apply it to the Express.js server as middleware.

Includes schema settings for resolvers and typeDefs as outlined in the Challenge instructions.

Modifies the existing authentication middleware to work in the context of a GraphQL API.

Uses an Apollo Provider so that the application can communicate with the Apollo Server.

Application must be deployed to Render.
